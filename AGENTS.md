# kajji Agent Guidelines

Follow the Boy Scout rule:
- For minor things, just improve them
- For larger improvements, lift to the user before expanding scope
- If you see a lack of testing in an area, offer to add

## Task management

Project work may be tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eliaskc/kajji/issues), but do not create new issues unless the user explicitly asks.

- Do not create GitHub issues proactively for bugs, features, improvements, or follow-up work
- Check existing issues only when the user asks, or when needed to reference issue-specific work
- Use labels when creating issues by explicit request: `bug`, `feature`, `needs-exploration`, `ui-polish`, `tech-debt`, `docs`
- Use Conventional Commits, but prefer unscoped types with specific subjects (`feat: add hunk navigation`, `fix: prevent file tree loops`, `refactor: unify modal keybinds`)
- Scopes are optional, not forbidden. Use one when it adds context that a concise subject would otherwise lack, especially for package-specific changes; avoid scopes that merely repeat an area already clear from the subject
- Reference issues in commit messages only when applicable and requested, or when already part of the task
- Close issues only when explicitly asked, or when completing work that the user clearly tied to an existing issue

## Build/Test Commands

- **Install**: `bun install`
- **Dev**: `bun dev` (runs TUI)
- **Test**: `bun test` (runs unit tests)
- **E2E test**: `bun test:e2e` (runs Terminal Control TUI workflows)
- **Microbenchmarks**: `bun test:bench` (parser/token/diff-data tests, not whole-TUI scrolling)
- **TUI benchmarks**: `bun bench:prepare`, `bun bench:tui`, `bun bench:compare` (see `docs/BENCHMARKING.md`)
- **Benchmark typecheck**: `bun bench:check`
- **Typecheck**: `bun check` (tsc --noEmit)
- **Lint**: `bun lint` (oxlint + oxfmt --check)
- **Lint fix**: `bun lint:fix` (oxlint --fix + oxfmt)
- **Schema**: `bun generate:schema` (updates generated config schema)
- **CLI/TUI entry**: `bun cli` (runs the app without watch mode)

## Dependency Source Research

When you need to understand OpenTUI, Solid, Bun, `@pierre/diffs`, or another dependency in detail, clone the upstream source repository into `/tmp` and inspect the current source directly. Prefer source analysis over relying on local reference docs or stale notes.

Suggested locations:
- OpenTUI: `git clone https://github.com/sst/opentui /tmp/opentui`
- @pierre/diffs: `git clone https://github.com/pierrecomputer/pierre /tmp/pierre`
- Bun: `git clone https://github.com/oven-sh/bun /tmp/bun`

Reuse an existing `/tmp` clone when present, and pull/update it before relying on it.

## Code Style

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript
- **Framework**: OpenTUI (Solid.js-based TUI framework)
- **Formatting**: oxfmt - 4-space indentation, no semicolons; linting via oxlint
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types
- **Imports**: Relative imports for local modules
- **Types**: Define interfaces in separate types.ts files when shared

## Bun

- **NEVER** run `bun src/index.tsx` directly - TUI apps will hang. Ask the user to run it manually.
- **NEVER** use `require()` - always use ESM imports at file top
- Use `bun add` to install packages, not `npm install`

## Solid.js

This project uses Solid.js, NOT React. Key differences:

- **State**: Use `createSignal`, not `useState`
  ```tsx
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal("initial")
  ```
- **Reading signals**: Must call as functions: `value()`, not `value`
  ```tsx
  // WRONG: <text>{value}</text>
  // CORRECT: <text>{value()}</text>
  ```
- **Mount effects**: Use `onMount`, not `useEffect`
  ```tsx
  onMount(() => {
    loadData()
  })
  ```
- **Input handling**: `<input>` uses `onInput`, receives string value not event
  ```tsx
  <input onInput={(value) => setValue(value)} />
  ```
- **No dependency arrays**: Solid tracks dependencies automatically - no `useEffect` deps needed

## Architecture

- **Entry**: `src/index.tsx` - process entrypoint; `src/tui.tsx` boots the TUI; `src/App.tsx` renders the root app
- **CLI**: `src/cli/` - non-TUI command modules and formatting helpers
- **Commander**: `src/commander/` - jj/gh CLI wrappers, streaming execution, and output parsers
- **Comments**: `src/comments/` - GitHub comment metadata and relocation utilities
- **Components**: `src/components/` - TUI components, including `panels/`, `modals/`, and diff views
- **Config**: `src/config/` - config loading, defaults, and Zod schema
- **Context**: `src/context/` - SolidJS providers for focus, commands, dialogs, sync, keybinds, loading, layout, and theme
- **Diff**: `src/diff/` - diff parsing/formatting types and helpers
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/` - shared Solid/OpenTUI hooks
- **Keybind**: `src/keybind/` - default keybind definitions, registry, parser, and display helpers
- **Theme**: `src/theme/` - theme definitions and presets (lazygit, opencode)
- **Types**: `src/types/` - shared type definitions
- **Utils**: `src/utils/` - shared utilities (file tree, editor launch, status colors, double-click detection)
- **Docs**: `docs/` - specs and design notes

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/` - mirrors src structure
- **E2E tests**: `tests/e2e/` - Terminal Control workflows, excluded from default `bun test` discovery
- **Benchmarks**: `tests/bench/` - performance tests with threshold assertions
- Run unit tests: `bun test`
- Run E2E tests sparingly: use `bun test:e2e` near task completion or when changes directly affect TUI workflows; do not run them after routine intermediate edits
- Run microbenchmarks: `bun test tests/bench/`
- For performance work, read `docs/BENCHMARKING.md`, reuse a prepared fixture, and record a real-TUI baseline before changes
- Do not run E2E tests or other CPU-heavy work concurrently with measured benchmarks
- Keep controller Bun and Terminal Control fixed when comparing target Bun/OpenTUI versions
- Changes to benchmark readiness/position hooks require a new baseline; do not compare measurements with different definitions

## Key Patterns

### Focus System (`src/context/focus.tsx`)
Panels have contexts like `log.revisions`, `log.files`, `log.oplog`, `refs.bookmarks`, `detail`, and `commandlog`. Commands register for specific contexts and only activate when that context matches.

### Command Registry (`src/context/command.tsx`, registrations in panels/App)
Commands are registered with `context`, `type`, `panel`, and `visibility`. The keybind system routes key presses to the appropriate command based on current focus. `visibility: "help-only"` hides a command from the status bar; `"status-only"` hides it from help; omit visibility to show in both.

### Dialog System (`src/context/dialog.tsx`)
Modal stack with backdrop overlay. Dialogs push/pop from stack. Theme-aware styling.

### Process Execution (`src/process/app-process.ts`, `src/commander/`)
All child processes run through the Effect `AppProcess` service, wrapped by commander-layer services (`Jj`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `StructuralDiff`, ...) and exposed to the UI via `ApplicationClient`. Do not call `Bun.spawn` directly in app code — the service layer provides typed errors, timeouts, env merging, child reaping, and cancellation via fiber interruption (`AbortSignal` at the client edge). Tests and benchmarks may spawn directly.

### Prefix Injection (Log Parsing)
We inject unique prefixes into `jj log` template output to reliably parse multi-line entries. See `src/commander/log.ts`.

## Dependency Updates

When checking dependency behavior or upgrade impact, inspect the dependency's source and release history from a `/tmp` clone rather than relying on summarized references. Use package manager metadata only to identify installed/latest versions.

## Reference Projects

When unsure about jj TUI patterns, clone and inspect relevant source repos under `/tmp`:
- **jjui** (Go): `git clone https://github.com/idursun/jjui /tmp/jjui`
- **lazyjj** (Rust): `git clone https://github.com/Cretezy/lazyjj /tmp/lazyjj`
- **lazygit** (Go): `git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit /tmp/lazygit`

Reuse existing clones when present, and update them before analysis.
