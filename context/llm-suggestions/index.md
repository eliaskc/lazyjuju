## What's Here

## How to Use

1. **Looking for ideas?** Browse these docs for patterns and approaches
2. **Want to implement something?** Move the feature to ROADMAP.md first
3. **Found something useful?** Extract relevant specs to ROADMAP.md under appropriate tier

These suggestions carry less weight than items in ROADMAP.md. They're reference material, not a backlog.
