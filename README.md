> The rudder for your jj

A simple terminal UI for [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit). Built with [OpenTUI](https://github.com/sst/opentui) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

While learning jj I found myself coming back to lazygit to view diffs and traverse the changes I'd made quickly and easily, which has become increasingly important to me with the rise of coding agents. While there are existing jj TUIs, none quite scratched that lazygit itch.

Kajji is my attempt to bring the simplicity and polish of lazygit to jj, while also leveraging coding agents effectively and building a TUI for the first time.

> Disclaimer: almost all code in this project has been written by coding agents (primarily Claude Opus 4.5 through [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)).

## Principles

- **Polish & simplicity** - Do less, but do it well.
- **Intuitive UX** - Sensible defaults, consistent patterns.
- **Snappy** - If it feels slow, it's a bug.

## Features

**Core jj operations:**
- [x] View commit log with graph
- [x] View diffs (difftastic, delta, etc.)
- [x] New / edit / describe / squash / abandon
- [x] Undo / redo with preview
- [x] Bookmarks (create, delete, rename, move)
- [x] Git fetch / push
- [x] Operation log with restore
- [ ] Rebase
- [ ] Split
- [ ] Conflict resolution

**TUI polish:**
- [x] Vim-style navigation (j/k, ctrl+u/d)
- [x] Mouse support (click, double-click, scroll)
- [x] Collapsible file tree with status colors
- [x] Help palette with fuzzy search (`?`)
- [ ] Multi-select for batch operations
- [ ] Search and filter
