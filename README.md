# kajji

A terminal UI for [jj / Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj): navigate changes, inspect polished diffs, and run common jj workflows with ease and speed.

Kajji gives jj a fast, keyboard-first interface with a commit graph, file tree, operation log, bookmark management, GitHub helpers, revset filtering, and custom diff rendering with syntax highlighting, word-level emphasis, split/unified layouts, wrapping, and binary-file handling.

## Installation

```bash
# recommended if you use Homebrew
brew install eliaskc/tap/kajji

# standalone binary installer, no package manager required
curl -fsSL https://kajji.sh/install.sh | bash

# or via JavaScript package manager
npm install -g kajji
bun install -g kajji
pnpm add -g kajji
yarn global add kajji

# or run directly without installing
npx kajji
bunx kajji
```

To remove kajji and its config/data:

```bash
kajji uninstall                       # interactive: removes config, data, and the binary
kajji uninstall --dry-run             # show what would be removed
kajji uninstall --keep-config --keep-data
kajji uninstall --force               # skip the confirmation prompt
```

### From source

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliaskc/kajji.git
cd kajji
bun install
bun dev
```

## Usage

Run `kajji` in any jj repository:

```bash
kajji                    # current directory
kajji /path/to/repo      # specific directory
```

Kajji has two main viewing modes:

- **Normal mode** keeps the log, bookmarks, detail, and command log visible.
- **Diff focus mode** gives the detail pane more space for side-by-side diffs.

Toggle between them with `ctrl+x`.

## Features

**jj workflows**

- Commit log with graph and revset filtering
- File view with tree/list toggle, editor launching, and discard for working-copy files
- New, edit, describe, squash, abandon, duplicate, rebase, split, resolve
- Undo, redo, operation log, and restore
- Bookmark create/delete/rename/forget/set/move plus remote-only filtering
- Git fetch/push menus
- Open commits and PRs on GitHub
- Recent repository switcher

**Diff viewing**

- Custom unified and split diff renderers
- Syntax highlighting and word-level change emphasis
- Line wrapping and horizontal scrolling
- Hunk and file navigation
- Optional jj formatter output
- Binary file detection

**TUI polish**

- Vim-style navigation plus mouse support
- Focusable panels and tabs
- Command palette with fuzzy search (`?` / `ctrl+p`)
- Context-aware status hints
- JSONC config with schema autocomplete
- Automatic update notifications

## CLI

Kajji includes a small CLI for scripting and agent workflows:

```bash
# List changes with addressable hunk IDs
kajji changes -r @

# Comments
kajji comment list -r @
kajji comment set -r @ --hunk h1 -m "note"
kajji comment set -r @ --file src/App.tsx --line 12 -m "note"
kajji comment delete -r @ --hunk h1
kajji comment delete -r @ --file src/App.tsx --line 12
kajji comment delete -r @ --file src/App.tsx
kajji comment delete -r @ --all -y
```

## Configuration

Kajji reads JSONC config from `~/.config/kajji/config.json` (comments and trailing commas are supported).

- Open it from the command palette (`?`) with `open config`
- Changes made through `open config` are reloaded when you return to kajji
- The default config includes `$schema: "https://kajji.sh/schema.json"` for editor autocomplete

Common settings include:

- `ui.themeMode`: `system`, `dark`, or `light`
- `ui.syntaxTheme.dark` / `ui.syntaxTheme.light`: syntax highlighting theme names
- `ui.showFileTree`: show files as a tree or flat list
- `diff.layout`: `auto`, `unified`, or `split`
- `diff.autoSwitchWidth`: terminal width where `auto` switches to split view
- `diff.wrap`: wrap long diff lines
- `diff.useJjFormatter`: use jj's configured diff formatter in the detail pane
- `gitHooksPath`: default Git-compatible hooks directory to check for `pre-commit` before `jj.new` (`.git/hooks` enables standard per-repo Git hooks in every repo)
- `repos`: repo-specific `gitHooksPath` and operation hooks keyed by repository path
- `whatsNewDisabled` / `autoUpdatesDisabled`: update notification controls

## Keybindings

Default keybindings are contextual. Press `?` or `ctrl+p` in kajji for the full command list available in the current panel.

| `o`       | Open selected bookmark's commit or PR on GitHub    |

When creating a PR, kajji suggests the nearest strict ancestor bookmark on `origin`,
using its remote position. Local-only bookmarks are ignored. If no ancestor qualifies,
kajji uses the target repository's default branch. You can change the base before
opening the browser. If several branches are equally near, kajji asks you to choose.
